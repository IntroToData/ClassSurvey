## Quotable

```{r include = FALSE}

math <- 1
code <- 1

For the purposes of this course, `math == code`

`r math == code`

## Class Survey

## Class Survey Story

- Alchemical process of converting raw data into knowledge

## What I hope you learn

- Develop and answer research questions.
- Download, manage, and characterize data.
- Use data to tell a compelling story.

## Maxims

1. Counting is hard.
2. If you are doing it manually - you are doing it wrongly.
3. If a marmot cannot understand your writing, neither can most
   humans.

## This is code


```{r}

library(dplyr); data(iris)
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarize(N = n())

```

## Prerequisites

- This _is_ a programming course, but I assume nothing.
- This course will focus on learning and process.
- Bring you curiousity, and you will succeed.

## First Textbook

- [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 
    - There is a dead-tree version available if you prefer. It costs
      money, but the author deserves it.
    - The online version is sufficient for the course.

Specific readings will be assigned from these additional resources:

- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
- [Andrew Gelman's blog: Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/)

## What is Data Science? (1)

![Data Science Venn Diagram](includes/Data_Science_VD.png)

## What is Data Science? (2)

- _Nobody_ can excel equally at all three of these
- The focus of this course:
    - Primary: Hacking Skills
    - Secondary: Math & Statistics Knowledge
- You will take other Statistics courses
- You will take Substantive Knowledge outside of this course
- Example data will either be simple, or I will help provide the
  Substantive Knowledge necessary to understand the data.

## Homework 1: Collect It Yourself

- Before you analyze any data, you should collect some.
- Collect the following information from five friends. The data
  must be collected in a spreadsheet. The data should be on the
  first worksheet.  The column names and data types are provided
  below. The spreadsheet must be either an Excel compatible
  workbook (xlsx) or Open Document Spreadsheet format
  (ods). Submit the workbook via Blackboard by 2018-01-25.
- Before gathering this data, thank your friend for participating
  and inform them that this is entirely voluntary and that they do
  not have to give you this information. This data will be used in
  class examples. If they skip a question, leave it blank.
- The file submitted via Blackboard should include the following:

## Projects

- Four projects in this course. 
- The first three projects account for 1/3 of your final grade. 
- Project 4 accounts for 1/3 of your final grade.

## Project 1: What Is The Question?

- Identify a topic you would like to use for a data-driven research
  project. Develop a rough draft of your research question and you
  will identify where you can access the data needed to answer your
  research question. You must submit the following:
- Feel free to use any other legal, free, public resource. Do
  not propose a project with Personal Health Information (PHI)
  or Personal Identifying Information (PII). 
    - _Any proposal based on PHI/PII data will be rejected_.
    - Please submit this via Blackboard to the Instructor on
      2018-02-01 as a Word, PDF, or plain text markdown file. If
      you use Word, please keep the formatting simple.
- There is a template available
